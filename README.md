# Mediation analysis in the presence of exposure measurement error under main study/validation study designs

We provide example R codes for implementing the proposed approaches to correct the bias due to exposure measurement error under a main study/validation study.


## List of Files

* Code_cont_EVS.R - R codes for mediation analysis for a continuous outcome (Scenario I) with an external validation study.
* Code_cont_IVS.R - R codes for mediation analysis for a continuous outcome (Scenario I) with an internal validation study.
* Code_bina_EVS.R - R codes for mediation analysis for a binary outcome (Scenario II) with an external validation study.
* Code_bina_IVS.R - R codes for mediation analysis for a binary outcome (Scenario II) with an internal validation study.

A brief instruction on how to implement the R code is provided at the end of each file.
